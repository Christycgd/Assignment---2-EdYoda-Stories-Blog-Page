          <p class="author">Edyoda <span class="date">|15 Jan 2023</span></p>
          <p class="content">Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical<br>techniques to give computer systems the ability to “learn”<br>(e.g., progressively improve performance on a specific task) from data, without being explicitly programmed.</p>

          <p class="content"> In today’s dynamic world, rapid web application development<br>with a smooth user interface that can adapt to specific features <br>is the main business requirement. Many organizations around the world that intensely depend on programming for their everyday business operations, the big business level applications, sites and servers have become apparent. It is important to use consistent, scalable and standardized software when developing a new application.</p>

          <p class="author">Edyoda <span class="date">|15 Jan 2023</span></p>
          <p class="content"> Cloud computing has been rapidly gaining pace in the world <br> of information technology. It has been observed that over 90% <br>of global enterprises are using cloud technology as part of their business. Every industry has its own technology dynamics designed to suit its infrastructure. To understand the future of cloud computing, one needs to understand the dynamics of cloud computing in various key industries. According to the reports by Dell companies that invest in Big Data, cloud, mobility and security enjoy up to 53% faster revenue growth than their competitors. As it is becoming more and more difficult to keep all the information, programs, and systems up and running on in-house computer servers, it has become necessary to store data on the cloud. </p>

          <p class="author">Edyoda <span class="date">|15 Jan 2023</span></p>
          <p class="content">Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence which is an<br>important part of computer science. The revolution of Big Data promises to <br> transform the way we work, live and think by enabling the process of optimization, discovering insights and improved decision making. This potential relies on the ability to extract value from big data and provide data analytics. Machine learning is the ability to learn from data, provide insights, predictions, suggestions from data which help in the decision-making process.</p>

          <p class="author">Edyoda <span class="date">|15 Jan 2023</span></p>
          <p class="content">As the dependency on online platforms is increasing daily,<br>cybersecurity is becoming an important concern for all companies today.<br>The number of cyberattacks is ever-rising even after adopting every security measure possible by businesses. Cyber attackers are developing advancing technologies that are continuing to cause more damage. There are many methods through which a cyber attack is committed like software vulnerabilities, user interaction (using malicious links, email attachments) and use of stolen credentials logins, encryption keys.</p>

            <h3 class="title"> What is Web Scraping?</h3>
            <p class="author">Zac Clancy <span class="date"> |25 Sep 2019</span></p>
            <p class="content">Simply put, web scraping is one of the tools developers use<br> to gather and analyze information from the Internet.
Some <br> websites and platforms offer application programming <br> interfaces (APIs) which we can use to access information in a structured way, but others might not. While APIs are certainly becoming the standard way of interacting with today’s popular platforms, we don’t always have this luxury when interacting with most of the websites on the internet.
                Rather than reading data from standard API responses, we’ll need to find the data ourselves by reading the website’s pages and feeds.</p>

            <p class="author">Edyoda <span class="date"> |14 Oct 2019</span></p>
            <p class="content">The term Income Share Agreement has been around for a long <br>time since 1955 to be precise. Surprised, eh? It was first<br> introduced by Milton Friedman, an American economist, <br>and statistician who strongly believed in “free-market capitalism”. In the last few months, there has been a lot of buzz around it, particularly among college graduates.

                So, what is this Income Share Agreement?</p>

            <h3 class="title"> Practical Machine Learning with Python and Keras</h3>
            <p class="author"> Daniel Pyrathon <span class="date"> |16 Oct 2019</span></p>
            <p class="content"> Machine learning is a field of artificial<br> intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer <br>systems the ability to “learn” (e.g., progressively improve<br> performance on a specific task) from data, without being explicitly programmed. Think of how efficiently (or not) Gmail detects spam emails, or how good text-to-speech has become with the rise of Siri, Alexa, and Google Home.

                Some of the tasks that can be solved by implementing Machine Learning include:
                
                Anomaly and fraud detection: Detect unusual patterns in credit card and bank transactions.
                Prediction: Predict future prices of stocks, exchange rates, and now cryptocurrencies.
                Image recognition: Identify objects and faces in images.
                Machine Learning is an enormous field, and today we’ll be working to analyze just a small subset of it.</p>
